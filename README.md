## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from the drive for self-improvement—becoming the best versions of ourselves. We asked ourselves, what’s the most efficient way to achieve this? By encouraging and reinforcing positive habits, replacing bad habits with good ones, and being able to visualize our progress, we believe people can become more self-aware and accountable.

On top of that, for many of us, our mothers are our biggest supporters in life. So, we incorporated the comforting and encouraging voice of a mother to guide users along their journey. This personal touch amplifies the effectiveness of the tool, making it not just a timetable but a supportive companion for self-improvement.

## What it does
Our project is an intelligent AI companion designed to help users stay accountable and disciplined on their journey to self-improvement. The AI listens to the user’s voice, understanding their needs and interacting in real time to provide encouragement and guidance. When a user submits a new event or task, the AI supports them throughout the process, offering motivation and ensuring they stay on track to meet their goals.

The platform is equipped with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact in their preferred language and seamlessly manage their schedules. By intelligently analyzing user inputs, the AI optimizes daily events, finding the most productive and efficient way to complete tasks. It's more than just a scheduling assistant—it’s a personalized accountability partner that empowers users to achieve their best, both in productivity and personal growth.

## How we built it
We integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT for voice recognition and interaction, allowing the AI to listen, respond, and guide users in real time. The voice assistant is seamlessly connected to a visually appealing, intuitive calendar interface, where users can easily manage their tasks and events.

On the backend, we utilized PostgreSQL to securely store and manage user data, ensuring that tasks, events, and schedules are efficiently saved and retrieved. The AI optimizes these events by analyzing user behavior and preferences, providing tailored recommendations for maximum productivity.

Additionally, the user interface was carefully designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, making it easy for users to interact with the system. We also implemented multi-language support to enhance accessibility and customization options, including the ability to adjust the AI's voice settings to match user preferences.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring that the AI responded in real time, particularly when optimizing voice recognition for fast and accurate responses. Another significant hurdle was getting the frontend to properly retrieve and display data from the database, which required linking all components smoothly. Additionally, we encountered several merge conflicts during collaboration, leading to lost progress when we didn’t save working versions of our code. Despite these setbacks, we continuously adapted and pushed through to keep the project on track.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Three out of the four members on our team were participating in their very first 48-hour hackathon, and we’re incredibly proud of how we pushed through the challenges that came our way. Despite the intensity and exhaustion, we stayed up through the night, constantly striving to implement as much as possible.

We are especially proud that our initial vision transformed into a tangible, working solution within such a short time. Seeing our concept come to life, from just an idea to something functional that we can already use ourselves, is incredibly rewarding. It ties directly into the theme of this hackathon—self-improvement—as the project is not only something we built but something that will genuinely help us in our own journeys toward becoming better versions of ourselves.

We are also grateful for the guidance of the fantastic mentors, and when faced with setbacks, we kept experimenting with different strategies until we found solutions. Our adaptability and determination made this journey truly worthwhile.

## What we learned
Throughout this hackathon, we learned just how powerful OpenAI can be, yet we were pleasantly surprised by how accessible it is for us to integrate into our personal projects. Working with the AI gave us a deeper understanding of how we can harness its capabilities to solve real-world problems, not just in theory but in practical, hands-on applications.

We also gained valuable insights into teamwork, adapting to rapid development cycles, and solving complex problems under tight deadlines. From managing databases to designing user-friendly interfaces, this experience taught us how different technologies can come together to create a seamless, functional product. Lastly, we learned the importance of persistence—by continuously experimenting and seeking help when needed, we were able to overcome obstacles and push through difficult moments.

## What's next for Timetable Sweetie
We plan to expand the functionality of Cute Timetable by adding a dedicated to-do list page, allowing users to manage their tasks more comprehensively. Additionally, we will implement a habit tracker, helping users build and maintain strong, positive habits for greater accountability. Beyond these, we envision integrating data analytics to provide users with personalized insights and progress reports, allowing them to visualize their improvement over time. We also plan to incorporate more AI-driven recommendations for optimizing daily routines based on user behavior, further enhancing productivity. Lastly, mobile app development is in our future to make Cute Timetable even more accessible for users on the go.
